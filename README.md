# Platzi Fake Store App
This is the main page of an online store, a project part of the Full Stack School at Platzi.
## Description
This project's goal is to build an online store from scratch. The principal components (like different menus for web and mobile views and interactive components) were built in different files to be implemented together after. The technologies used were HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. 
## Authors and acknowledgment
The development of this project was made by me with the help of the Practice JS Course in Platzi. The components were built in a previous course: the Front-End Development course. The design for the components were entirely provided by the Platzi Team.
